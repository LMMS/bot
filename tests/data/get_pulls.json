    "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nHere is a small batch of improvements for the new spectrum analyzer; it includes mostly some additional features I mentioned in the original PR as \"planed for the future\", and also separation of all data processing from the audio thread, so that FFT and GUI performance cannot interrupt audio stream by long processing spikes.\r\n\r\nStatus is ~~**review needed**, but before I can say all is final, I'll first need to wait how the web build system handles the new ringbuffer submodule (some local changes were needed and I'm not sure if everything necessary made it upstream yet).~~   work in progress (changes needed in ringbuffer library).\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n 1.1.0\t2019-08-29\r\n - advanced config: expose hidden constants to user\r\n![screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20932751/63965611-d7276100-ca99-11e9-9731-c13ec3da15cd.png)\r\n - advanced config: add support for FFT window overlapping\r\nIf the signal (red) contains a fast transient, it can fall to a place between blocks, where FFT window function squishes it to zero (right side); such transient would be invisible on the waterfall display; by overlapping the blocks / windows (left) it can be ensured that all transients are always covered, at the cost of processing each sample multiple times.\r\n![fft_window_overlap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20932751/63965900-7e0bfd00-ca9a-11e9-8d60-d699c20a4493.png)\r\n - waterfall: display at native resolution on high-DPI screens\r\n - waterfall: add cursor and improve label density\r\n - FFT: fix normalization so that 0 dBFS matches full-scale sinewave\r\n - FFT: decouple data acquisition from processing and display\r\n - FFT: separate lock for reallocation (to avoid some needless waiting)\r\n - moved ranges and other constants to a separate file\r\n - debug: better performance measurements",

    "body": "Adds the native support for the following MIDI events in VeSTige:\r\n- Program Change\r\n- Controller Change for controllers 0 and 32, which are Bank Select MSB and LSB, respectively\r\n\r\nThe patch adds two toggle switches to VeSTIge GUI:\r\n- Capture Program Change events\r\n- Use Bank Select LSB\r\nwhich are loadable and saveable. To make the room for new switches it was neccessary to reorganize slightly the existing user interface - \"Show/Hide GUI\" and \"Stop all notes\" buttons were reduced to the form of icons. Additionally, the MIDI preset number was moved from preset name line to the \"Preset:\" caption above it, so that there is more space for the actual preset name.\r\n\r\n**Description of new features**\r\n\r\nWhen \"Capture Program Change events\" switch is on, the events above are captured directly by VeSTige and used to determine the ID of preset to switch to; the VST plugin will not receive these events. When the switch is off the MIDI events will be passed through to the plugin.\r\n\r\nWhen \"Use Bank Select LSB\" switch is on, both controllers 0 and 32 are used. The values are combined to obtain the bank number between 0 and 16383 (2^14 - 1). When the switch is off, only controller 0 is used and is treated as LSB. This allows to choose banks between 0 and 127 (2^7 - 1). This allows to work with MIDI devices that use either of the approaches.\r\n\r\nThe target preset ID is determined from the bank number and the program number. Presets 0 to 127 belong to bank 0, presets 128..255 fall into bank 1, presets 256..383 belong to bank 2, and so on.\r\n\r\nReception of the Program Change and/or Bank Select messages will trigger the update of the VeSTige GUI, so the preset name is visible immediately.\r\n\r\n**Validation of changes**\r\n_Preparation_\r\n- Connect any MIDI controller capable of sending subject messages (e. g. Alesis QX49)\r\n- Add VeSTige to the song editor and load any VST plugin that has its GUI and at least a few presets. I have used SuperWave P8 and SQ8L.\r\n- Enable the MIDI input. If you use ALSA Sequencer as MIDI interface, pick appropriate MIDI device from the list.\r\n- Open the VST GUI window\r\n\r\n_Validating Program Change_\r\n- Having both switches disabled, trigger Program Change event at your controller.\r\n  - if the plugin you loaded accepts Program Change messages (e. g. SuperWave P8), you will see a change in the plugin's GUI, but no change of the preset in VeSTige\r\n  - if the plugin does not handle Program Change (e. g. SQ8L), there will be no change in the GUI\r\n- Enable \"Capture Program Change events\" switch and trigger Program Change event.\r\n  - the preset name displayed in VeSTige GUI should change according to the program number received, contents of plugin's GUI should be updated as well\r\n\r\n_Validating Bank Select_\r\nNote: here I recommend using a VST plugin with more than 128 presets.\r\n- Enable \"Use Bank Select LSB\" switch\r\n- Send Program Change with the value of 0\r\n  - the first preset should be selected\r\n- Send Bank Select MSB with the value of 0 and Bank Select LSB with the value of 1\r\n  - the 129th preset should be selected (bank 1, program 0, meaning Preset ID=128)\r\n- Send Bank Select LSB with the value of 2\r\n  - the 257th preset should be selected (bank 2, program 0, meaning Preset ID=256)\r\n- Send Bank Select MSB with the value of 1 and Bank Select LSB with the value of 0\r\n  - the last preset should be selected (bank 128, program 0, meaning Preset ID=16384)\r\n\r\n- Disable \"Use Bank Select LSB\" switch\r\n- Send Bank Select MSB with the value of 0 and Bank Select LSB with the value of 1\r\n  - the first preset should be selected (bank 0, program 0, meaning Preset ID=0)\r\n- Send Bank Select LSB with any value\r\n  - there should be no reaction of the plugin\r\n- Send Bank Select MSB with the value of 1\r\n  - the 129th preset should be selected (bank 1, program 0, meaning Preset ID=128)\r\n\r\n_Validating save & load_\r\n- Set any state of the switches in VeSTige GUI, then save the project\r\n- Open a new project\r\n- Reopen the previously saved project\r\n- Open the GUI of the instance of VeSTige loaded into the project\r\n  - the state of switches should be the same as when the project was saved\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\nChange in scope of #5138 (already closed) which is actually a part of #1472.\r\nThe pull request includes a fix for #5139 which has not yet been merged to the master branch, but is required by the new feature.",

    "body": "Fixes #4892\r\n\r\nI created a subclass of QMenu and overloaded the `keyReleaseEvent` to send the event to the parent widget. Passing the event directly didn't work. So I cloned the event in the stack and sent it to parent. [This seems to be the usual practice.](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qq/qq11-events.html)\r\n\r\nThis does NOT solve the related bug #3654 because it's about `keyPressEvent`. Also QMenu blocks the CTRL key. Try opening the edit menu and then pressing CTRL+S. QMenu only sends the S key.",

    "body": "Enhancement for #241.\r\n\r\nThis will look for a `notes.xml` file in the default working directory. If found, it will load those chords and scales instead of the default ones. I decided to load only one or the other because it gives the option (currently requiring manual moving/deleting/updating/whatever of the file) of changing out XML files in case a user wanted to only see certain chords/scales for a project.\r\n\r\nPossible future enhancement: Link projects to custom scale/chord files.\r\n\r\nThe XML file is laid out as so:\r\n```xml\r\n<notes>\r\n  <chords>\r\n    <chord name=\"Major\">\r\n      <semiTone key=\"0\"/>\r\n      ...\r\n    </chord>\r\n    ...\r\n  </chords>\r\n  <scales>\r\n    <scale name=\"Major\">\r\n      <semiTone key=\"0\"/>\r\n      ...\r\n    </scale>\r\n    ...\r\n  </scales>\r\n</notes>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the current chords/scales are set with the equivalent to [pitch class integer notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class#Integer_notation) the `key`s follow the same.\r\n\r\nThere is a little leeway with getting the `<semiTone>` nodes as it doesn't actually look for the node name, so technically as long as the `key` attribute is there it could be called anything.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR \"fixes\" the `Chord stacking & arpeggio` tab to only list actual chords in the Stacking combobox, instead of including scales as well. I doubt anyone wants to hit all the notes of the scale at the same time. I left the Arpeggio combobox to include them though.\r\n\r\nAnother slight change is to the `octave` chord to actually play the next octave up (I don't see the point of having it if it's just the note you select). If this is incorrect then I can revert that line.\r\n\r\n![lmms-user-chords](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2244945/65710216-2c826e00-e058-11e9-8f68-9a1e64689cb1.PNG)\r\n\r\n![lmms-user-scales](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2244945/65710165-0f4d9f80-e058-11e9-8117-d64fdfb2a969.PNG)\r\n",

The code will be ugly.  Please be gentle (but obviously point out any problems you find).\r\n\r\nI had approximately 33 people test this out, so hopefully it's mostly bug-free.  \r\n\r\nHere's a Pastebin link to its current manual, which is also included within the synthesizer: https://pastebin.com/ADbcj3Uv\r\nIt explains most of its features.\r\n\r\nGraph.cpp and Graph.h were edited to give Microwave a cool new graph style.\r\nKnob.cpp and Knob.h were edited to add a new colored knob type, which allows the knobs to be colored within the code.\r\nSampleBuffer.h was edited to allow choosing which ear of a waveform to load.\r\nLcdSpinBox.cpp was edited to fix a bug where custom LCD Spinbox images were ignored.\r\nOtherwise, all files included in this PR were not in LMMS previously.",

A marker appears showing where the split will occur.\r\n- The mouse can be dragged around. Split position is quantized to song editor Q by default\r\n- Holding ctrl or alt disables quantization.\r\n- Holding shift snaps the cut position to a quantized offset from the clip's left or right edge, whichever is closer to the cursor. This means at least one of the new clips after the cut will have a quantized length (both, if the original length is a multiple of the current snap size).\r\n- On release, the clip will be split, unless the mouse was moved off to either side (or is exactly at the start/end position).",

    "body": "WIP Fix for #5169.\r\n\r\nMy first attempt was to capture `MainWindow`'s `wheelEvent` but there were times when that wouldn't capture the event properly. I took the step to subclass QMdiArea just to capture `wheelEvent`s for this purpose.\r\n\r\nCurrently scrolling works unless you are hovering over the Song Editor or Piano Roll. I'm looking into how to handle those cases.\r\n\r\nVertical and horizontal scrolling will double speed when using the Control key. I haven't looked into how much more this should be, but it's a modifier to the scroll wheel angle delta. Subtraction is used because of positive/negative angle delta values for scrolling backwards/forwards.\r\n\r\nBy Qt's documentation, most mouse steps are 15 degrees (what I get when I scroll is +/-15), but some may be smaller. In those cases this will scroll slower, so we could use a constant number or figure out another approach to use.\r\n\r\nI'm not certain if this will work on track pad's scrolling, I don't have one to test with.",

    "body": "The last sidebranch for the Lv2 core implementation #4899 .\r\n\r\nThis implements a container for multiple equal groups of linked models and\r\nsuiting views. Such groups are suited for representing mono effects where each\r\nModel occurs twice. A group provides Models for one mono processor and is\r\nvisually represented with a group box.\r\n\r\n![preview on branch lv2-review](https://i.imgur.com/A44OSFp.png)\r\n\r\nThe result is a dialogue like in LADSPA. You currently can't see this branches\r\nchanges unless you're on branch `lv2-review`. Loading and saving is also\r\nmissing yet because it's not part of the Lv2 core, and thus can not be tested.\r\n\r\nThere's known bug #4904 which however also occurs in LADSPA and is likely\r\nrelated to `AutomatableModel`. It won't be fixed on this branch.\r\n\r\nFor the long term, I plan moving LADSPA (and SPA on its sidebranch) to use\r\nthe `LinkedModelGroups` classes, in order to refactor code.",
